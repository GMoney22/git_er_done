# git_er_done
A place for Technical Writers to get comfortable with the command line.

This repo was the product of Lightning Talk during Write the Docs 2019. It was going to be a place to collaborate. About half of the group was extremely comfortable with git, and the other half wasn't very experienced but wanted to learn. I am somewhere in the middle :)

This plan didn't really pan out, but I will leave this repo open in case we revisit this valuable idea.

The seed of an idea was to create an analogy of opening a new file, saving, and renaming that file on a local machine. Similarly, you check out a new branch, push those changes, and commit new changes. Obviously, this analogy requires some examples, but that was the basic idea.

The other part was to only include the most basic commands that you need during a normal workday (as a starting point for beginners).
* `checkout` a new branch
* `add` files
* `commit`
* `push`
* `pull` (fetch and merge)
